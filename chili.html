						<p>The world famous dish started from a pushcart in 1956. ... Madam Cher Yam Tian's first attempt was stir-fried crabs with tomato sauce, but decided the dish will have more kick by adding chilli sauce.
						They sold their chilli crabs along Kallang River and it became so popular that they opened a restaurant, called Palm Beach.
						Chilli Crab is a Southeast Asian seafood dish originating from Singapore. Mud crabs are commonly used and are stir-fried in a semi-thick, sweet and savoury tomato-and-chilli-based sauce.
						It is listed at number 35 on the World's 50 most delicious foods list compiled by CNN Go in 2011
						</p>
						<p> Eating chilli crab is a messy business and requires you to leave decorum at the door. Popular accompaniments include crusty bread and mantou, Chinese steamed buns, 
						which are great for mopping up all the wonderful sauce. Of course steamed rice does the trick too. Despite its name, chilli crab is only mildly spicy, and is often described as having a flavour that's both sweet and savoury. 
						The crab is divine but the sauce is the starâ€”sweet yet savoury, slightly spicy and supremely satisfying.</p>
