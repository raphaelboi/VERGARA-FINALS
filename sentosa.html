						<p>Sentosa Island, known mononymously as Sentosa, and formerly Pulau Blakang Mati, is an island located off the southern coast of Singapore's main island.
						The island is separated from the main island of Singapore by a channel of water, the Keppel Harbour, and is adjacent to Pulau Brani, a smaller island wedged between Sentosa and the main island.
						Formerly used as a British military base and afterwards as a Japanese prisoner-of-war camp, the island was renamed Sentosa and was planned to be a popular tourist destination.</p> 
						<p>It is now home to a popular resort that receives more than twenty million visitors per year.[2] Attractions include a 2 km (1.2 mi) long sheltered beach, Madame Tussauds Singapore, an extensive Cable Car network,
						Fort Siloso, two golf courses, 14 hotels and the Resorts World Sentosa, which features the Universal Studios Singapore theme park and one of Singapore's two casinos, the other being in Marina Bay Sands.</p>
						<p>Sentosa’s several kilometres of pristine coastline and three separate beaches offer numerous ways to entertain yourself. Pack a picnic basket from home and pick a shady spot and settle down. Go for a swim,
						and for that we like Tanjong Beach’s clear and safe waters best. For sweltering hot days, spend some time in the air-conditioned comfort of Madame Tussauds Singapore (reopening from 1 Jul 2020) while you rub shoulders with the life-like wax statues of movie stars,
						sports celebrities and state leaders.If you are a Bollywood buff, they have a large cast of Indian movie stars and a new Ultimate Film Star Experience starring acclaimed director-actor Karan Johar, and Shahid Kapoor. Marvel fans will love the 4D Cinema experience, 
						and there is a Spirit of Singapore boat ride, and so much more to do.</p>
						<p> It’s time to bring on the squeals and screams back to Sentosa as Universal Studios Singapore reopens from 1 July. Become a part of the action when you put your intestinal fortitude to the test aboard Universal Studios Singapore’s rollercoaster rides, 
						which include Revenge of the Mummy, Battlestar Galactica: HUMAN vs. CYLON and TRANSFORMERS The Ride: The Ultimate 3D Battle.</p>
