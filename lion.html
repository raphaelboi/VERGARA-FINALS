						<p>A night shot of visitors taking photographs using the Merlion as the backdrop
						The Merlion's body symbolises Singapore's humble beginnings as a fishing village when it was called Temasek, which comes from the same root as the word tasek ('lake' in Malay).
						Its head represents Singapore’s original name, Singapura, or ‘lion city’ in Malay.
						Today, you can glimpse this legend at Merlion Park. Spouting water from its mouth, the Merlion statue stands tall at 8.6 metres and weighs 70 tonnes.
						This icon is a must-see for tourists visiting Singapore, similar to other significant landmarks around the world.
						Built by local craftsman Lim Nang Seng, it was unveiled on 15 September 1972 by then Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew at the mouth of the Singapore River, to welcome all visitors to Singapore.</p>
						<p>On the move
						With the completion of Esplanade Bridge in 1997, the statue could no longer be viewed clearly from the waterfront.
						So in 2002, the Merlion was relocated 120 metres away from the original position to where it stands in Merlion Park today, in front of Fullerton Hotel and overlooking Marina Bay.
						The park also houses a smaller Merlion statue. Known as the ‘Merlion cub’, it stands at two metres tall and weighs three tonnes.
						The original sculpture and its cub are the most well-known among the seven approved Merlion statues in Singapore. See if you can spot the rest on your trip here: there's one at Tourism</p>
						<p>Take Incredibly Beautiful Pictures At The Helix Bridge. The Helix Bridge is the world’s first curved double helix bridge and a remarkable piece of architecture. Its a pedestrian connection across the head of the Singapore river between Central Business District (CBD) and its new Bayfront district. 
						Tourists love to capture this piece of beauty in their cameras. It is also a wonderful place to take a long walk with your love.
						Other things you can do on your honeymoon include, star gazing at Science Center Observatory, exploring Haw Par Villa park, having breakfast with Orangutans in Singapore Zoo, and exploring a serene island called Pulau Ubin. 
						You can also check out some really interesting free things to do in Singapore to add some more fun to your honeymoon trip</p>
						<p>Snap Photos of the Merlion
						Visiting Singapore is not “official” if you haven’t taken photos of the spouting water Merlion statue. During the day the place might be a wee bit crowded, but you can still take great photos. However, during the night,
						savor the magical ambiance of the city and take some picturesque landscape of the Merlion and the city.</p>
