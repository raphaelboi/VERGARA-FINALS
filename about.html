						<p>It may be the one of the most expensive cities in the world, but Singapore has racked up plenty of other superlatives: cleanest, best planned, and, quite possibly, most entertaining. 
						The Lion City is home to the largest rooftop infinity pool, the world's first safari park for nocturnal animals, centuries-old temples and, of course, some of the best food on the planet.
						You'll also find extraordinary gardens, impressive architecture, world-class performance venues, and shopping streets. The city-state offers a fascinating melding of the old and new, the historic and the modern. 
						Since the pandemic, most of the attractions have reopened safely, adhering to Singapore’s safe management measures and SG Clean certification guidelines</p>
						<p>Singapore is the country’s capital and its only city. It’s a large business and shopping centre. But don’t get too excited, there’s not much sympathy for consumers who are cautious with their money. 
						But you can have a go at haggling even in the most modern of shopping centres. There are massive sales in June and July. Public transport is perfectly organised, though you should still think twice before taking out that sandwich on a metro. 
						Before entering the city centre, you can get into one of the numerous cars that are waiting for travellers, as they can’t drive off without them, but you should still tour the city on foot and experience the world of views, sounds and smells.</p>
						<p>The city-state lies on the main island and encompasses additional fifty smaller neighbouring islands. The city of Singapore differs from its neighbouring Asian metropolises mostly in cleanliness and tidiness. The airport in Singapore is an international hub, which means flight connections to this part of the world are excellent.
						More than fifty large ships arrive in the country’s port each day. Tourism is booming and communicating doesn’t pose any difficulties because English is an official language. English traditions, however, are noticeable elsewhere, for example, lining up in queues.
						Singapore is one of the wealthiest countries in the world and it also intends to remain as such, including through its strict laws. One of these laws imposed a ban on chewing gum sales. Travellers are particularly advised against littering while exploring the country because it can result in fines and street cleaning punishment.</p>
						<p>What else can you do in Singapore? Well, don’t carry around any durians, that’s for sure. It’s a quite smelly fruit and you can’t go everywhere with it. Plus, it can easily be smelled, you can be sure of that. And, of course, don’t ever criticise the president.</p>
