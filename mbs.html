						<p>Marina Bay Sands is an integrated resort fronting Marina Bay in Singapore, owned by the Las Vegas Sands Corporation. At its opening in 2010, it was billed as the world's most expensive standalone casino property at S$8 billion (US$6.88 billion),
						including the land cost. The resort includes a 2,561-room hotel, a 120,000-square-metre (1,300,000 sq ft) convention-exhibition centre, the 74,000-square-metre (800,000 sq ft)</p> 
						<p>The Shoppes at Marina Bay Sands mall, a museum, a large theatre,
						"celebrity chef" restaurants, two floating crystal pavilions, art-science exhibits, and the world's largest atrium casino with 500 tables and 1,600 slot machines. The complex includes three towers topped by a connecting 340-metre-long (1,120 ft) 
						SkyPark with a capacity of 3,902 people and a 150 m (490 ft) infinity swimming pool, set on top of the world's largest public cantilevered platform, which overhangs the north tower by 66.5 m (218 ft). The 20-hectare resort was designed by Moshe Safdie architects.</p>
						<p>You’ve arrived in Singapore, all ready to begin a day of exploring – and then, it begins to rain. Tourists will tell you that being stuck in one of Singapore’s rainstorms is an experience as unique as the island itself. Thankfully, 
						there are plenty of indoor activities that will keep you warm and dry. Spend an entire day indoors at Marina Bay Sands and never run out of interesting things to do! After eating, you’ll want to walk those calories off — so it’s time to shop! The Shoppes at Marina Bay Sands represent some of the world’s biggest fashion brands’ flagship stores, 
						as well as a whole range of other fashion and lifestyle shopping. When your feet get tired, take a boat ride on a sampan, right inside the Marina Bay Sands resort. Sampans are long, flat-bottomed boats which are commonly used in in Southeast Asia to get around rural areas. If you don’t feel like getting on a boat, grab a cup of coffee and find a sheltered spot overlooking the bay, 
						watching the city disappear behind the layers of rain.</p>
